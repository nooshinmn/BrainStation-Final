# Project Title
H&M Recommendation System
# Description
Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).A recommender system is a system that tries to predict the value a customer would buy or like in the next interaction. To calculate this prediction recommender systems can combine different data models.
# Outline
Explicit v.s. Implicit ratings
There are two ways to gather user preference data to recommend items, the first method is to ask for explicit ratings from a user, typically on a concrete rating scale (such as rating a movie from one to five stars) making it easier to make extrapolations from data to predict future ratings. However, the drawback with explicit data is that it puts the responsibility of data collection on the user, who may not want to take the time to enter ratings. On the other hand, implicit data is easy to collect in large quantities without any extra effort on the part of the user. Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to work with.
# Getting Started
## Data
We got our dataset from the H&M competition “H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations”, on which we performed some preliminary data exploration and preprocessing.
## Business Questions
• What is customers preference for the next purchase?
• What is the best approach to recommend new items?
## Modelling
